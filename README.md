## ⚠️ Important: Avoiding Duplicate Events

**If you import this calendar file multiple times, it WILL create duplicate events.** Each import is treated as a new set of events.

### How to Prevent Duplicates:

1. **Before Re-importing:** Delete the previously imported events first
2. **Use a Separate Calendar:** Import into a dedicated "Salesforce Events" calendar that you can easily delete and re-import
3. **Check UIDs:** Each event has a unique identifier (UID), but most calendar apps don't automatically merge duplicates

### Recommended Approach:

**Create a dedicated calendar for these events:**

- **Google Calendar:** Create a new calendar called "Salesforce Events 2026" and import there
- **Outlook:** Import as a new calendar rather than adding to your main calendar
- **Apple Calendar:** Create a new calendar specifically for Salesforce events

This way, if you need to update events, you can simply:
1. Delete the entire "Salesforce Events 2026" calendar
2. Create a new one
3. Re-import the updated file

### If You Already Have Duplicates:

- **Google Calendar:** Search for the event name, select all duplicates, and delete
- **Outlook:** Use the search function to find duplicates and delete them
- **Apple Calendar:** Search for the event and manually delete duplicates



## ✨ Features

- ✅ All events marked as "busy" on your calendar
- ✅ Complete event descriptions with website URLs
- ✅ Location information for each event
- ✅ Multi-day events properly configured
- ✅ Compatible with all major calendar applications



## 🔄 Manual Maintenance Process

This calendar is maintained **manually** by running the `check-cfp-status.js` script to update event status information:

### 📋 Execution Process

To update the calendar status:

1. **Run the script manually**:
   ```bash
   cd salesforce-community-events
   node check-cfp-status.js
   ```

2. **Dynamic Event Discovery**: Fetches the complete list of Salesforce community events directly from the official Salesforce API
   - **New events automatically included**: Any events added to Salesforce's system are discovered and added when the script runs
   - **No manual intervention required**: The script processes all events for 2026-2027 regardless of whether they were previously tracked

3. **Status Checking**: For each event, the script:
   - Checks if the event website is accessible
   - Scans for Call for Presenters (CFP) openings
   - Looks for ticket sales information
   - Searches for sponsorship opportunities
   - Applies 10-second timeouts to prevent hanging on unresponsive sites

4. **Smart Ordering**: Events are automatically sorted with:
   - **Future events first**: Upcoming events appear at the top
   - **Past events**: Events that have already occurred are moved to the bottom with CFP/Ticket status set to TBD (unless future years are mentioned)
   - **Unknown events last**: Events with unknown/pending websites are grouped at the end

5. **README Update**: The Events Overview Table is updated with the latest status information

### 🔄 Event Lifecycle

- **Discovery**: New events from Salesforce API are included when the script is run
- **Status Updates**: CFP, ticket, and sponsor status updated when script is executed
- **Error Handling**: Events with inaccessible websites are marked as errors but retained
- **Overrides**: Specific events can have manual overrides for known URLs (CFP, tickets, sponsors)

### 📅 Recommended Update Schedule

- Run the script **weekly** to keep status information current
- Run after major Salesforce community announcements
- Run when you notice events with outdated status information
