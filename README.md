## ⚠️ Important: Avoiding Duplicate Events

**If you import this calendar file multiple times, it WILL create duplicate events.** Each import is treated as a new set of events.

### How to Prevent Duplicates:

1. **Before Re-importing:** Delete the previously imported events first
2. **Use a Separate Calendar:** Import into a dedicated "Salesforce Events" calendar that you can easily delete and re-import
3. **Check UIDs:** Each event has a unique identifier (UID), but most calendar apps don't automatically merge duplicates

### Recommended Approach:

**Create a dedicated calendar for these events:**

- **Google Calendar:** Create a new calendar called "Salesforce Events 2026" and import there
- **Outlook:** Import as a new calendar rather than adding to your main calendar
- **Apple Calendar:** Create a new calendar specifically for Salesforce events

This way, if you need to update events, you can simply:
1. Delete the entire "Salesforce Events 2026" calendar
2. Create a new one
3. Re-import the updated file

### If You Already Have Duplicates:

- **Google Calendar:** Search for the event name, select all duplicates, and delete
- **Outlook:** Use the search function to find duplicates and delete them
- **Apple Calendar:** Search for the event and manually delete duplicates



## ✨ Features

   - Modify event times or descriptions
   - Add your own custom events
   - Filter to only certain regions or event types

4. **Example prompts:**
   ```

   "Keep only the Dreamin' events, remove Dreamforce and TrailblazerDX"
   "Change all event times to start at 9:00 AM"
   "Add a reminder 1 week before each event"
   "Remove tentative events and keep only confirmed ones"
   ```
