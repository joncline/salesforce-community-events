## Brief overview
This rule ensures that all events in the Salesforce Community Events README file are properly sorted by date in ascending order (earliest to latest) to maintain consistency and improve user experience.

## Event table organization
  - Always sort events in the Events Overview Table by Date column in ascending order (earliest to latest)
  - Events should be listed chronologically from January through December for each year
  - Multi-day events should be sorted by their start date
  - When adding new events, insert them in the correct chronological position

## Date format consistency
  - Use consistent date format: "Month Day, Year" (e.g., "January 30, 2026")
  - For multi-day events, use range format: "Month Day-Day, Year" (e.g., "March 25-27, 2026")
  - Ensure all dates are properly formatted and consistent throughout the table

## Year grouping
  - Group events by year (2026, 2027) while maintaining chronological order within each year
  - 2026 events should appear before 2027 events
  - Within each year, events should be sorted chronologically

## Maintenance requirements
  - When updating the README with new events or date changes, always re-sort the entire table
  - Verify chronological order after any modifications to event dates
  - Use date sorting as a validation step before finalizing README updates
